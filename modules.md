## Modules

R2DBC is comprised of several official modules.

### First and foremost, is the **Service Provider Interface (SPI)**

* [r2dbc-spi](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi) - set of interfaces defining the SPI for R2DBC.
* [r2dbc-spi-test](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi/tree/master/r2dbc-spi-test) - a **Test Compatibility Kit (TCK)** contained within the SPI repository for verifying your data store's implementation.

### Drivers

* [r2dbc-postgres](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-postgresql) - driver implemented for PostgreSQL.
* [r2dbc-h2](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-h2) - driver implemented for H2.

### Clients

* [r2dbc-client](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-client) - client implemented on top of the SPI using pure Reactor (i.e. no Spring dependencies).
* spring-data-r2dbc - Repository-based Spring Data implementation using R2DBC under the hood.
